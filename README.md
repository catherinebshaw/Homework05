# The Work-Day Scheduler

## User Experience

The Work Day Scheduler is a simple simple calendar application that allows a user to input and save events for each hour of the day during a regular 8-4 work day. As the day progresses, the current hour is highlighted in red while past hours are illustrated in grey and future hours in green. 

## Technology Used

At the direction of the client, I used Moment.js to set the current date and time. Local storage was also used to ensure that user entries persisted after browser refresh.
